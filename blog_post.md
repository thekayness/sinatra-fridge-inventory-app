Thoughts:
Think of how your moving parts fit into the bigger picture/context of things you've learned.

Feel the synergy, how is something you want to create emulating something you've already made?
-but also look for jumping off points for something new

Reduce, reuse, recycle!!!
-file tree structure (app>mvc, config, db) to specific methods (slugify)
-sounds like cheating, but learning how to imagine new things
within the framework of your current knowledge and relate it to something already in existence is working those concepts!
-connect the dots, maybe in the same ways, maybe in new ways!


Write your tests first
-it's called test driven development for a reason
-if you can tell how to make a test work with the idea you have, you understand the concept
-sometimes the tests are their own language, and you realize you need to put more into learning about them

Separate concerns by priority
-needs to work vs would like to work

Would like:
-change edit link to button
-validate date input
-confirm password?
-empty fridge text
