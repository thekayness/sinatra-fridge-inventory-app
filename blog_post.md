Thoughts:
Think of how your moving parts fit into the bigger picture/context of things you've learned.

Feel the synergy, how is something you want to create emulating something you've already made?

Reduce, reuse, recycle!!!
-file tree structure (app>mvc, config, db) to specific methods (slugify)
-sounds like cheating, but learning how to imagine new things 
within the framework of your current knowledge and relate it to something already in existence is working those concepts!
-connect the dots, maybe in the same ways, maybe in new ways!
